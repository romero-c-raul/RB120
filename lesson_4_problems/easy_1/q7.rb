# What is the default return value of to_s when invoked on an object? 
# Where could you go to find out if you want to be sure?

# The default return value would be the object class, an encoding of the object,
# and any instance variables initialized within the object

# You can double check this by going into ruby docs, and looking for the 
# documentation of the Object#to_s method.
